# Icon Hover Effect 

## Description
This project demonstrates a simple web page with social media icons that change color on hover. The colors are dynamically applied based on the social media platform:
- **Instagram**: Pink
- **LinkedIn**: Dark Blue
- **GitHub**: Light Green
- **Twitter**: Light Blue
- **Email**: Yellow

The page uses Font Awesome icons for social media and custom CSS to apply the hover effects.

## How It Works
1. The icons are wrapped in anchor (`<a>`) elements pointing to their respective social media links.
2. In the CSS file (`style.css`), different color styles are applied to the icons when hovered.
3. The `script.js` adds a custom cursor effect that follows the mouse pointer and changes size on hovering over icons.

## Files Overview

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and social media icons.
- `style.css`: The CSS file with custom styles and hover effects.
- `script.js`: A script for custom cursor behavior (optional).

## Features

- **Hover Effects**: Icons change color on hover.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and centers on the page.
- **Custom Cursor**: A custom cursor follows the mouse pointer.

## Usage

1. Add your desired URLs for each social media icon in the `index.html` file.
2. Open `style.css` to modify colors or adjust icon sizes if needed.
3. View the page in your browser to see the dynamic color changes.
